Firstly, thanks to all the users who have been uploading, testing and sharing Doarama&trade; visualizations.  There has been a lot of helpful feedback, suggestions and bug reports.  This is valuable for us and helps us decide the future direction of the service so please don't hesitate to contact us.

### Log In UX

![Log In]({{ site.url }}/assets/2013-08-30-login.jpg)

The menus at **doarama.com** now clearly indicate whether or not you are logged in. 

### Upload

![Upload]({{ site.url }}/assets/2013-08-30-upload.jpg)

The upload page will now check gps track files are valid before they are uploaded to **doarama.com**.  Please report any problem files to support@doarama.com.

### Location

![Locations]({{ site.url }}/assets/2013-08-30-location.jpg)

Locations of activities are now recorded when you upload a file.

### API

We have had a number of requests for an API to allow creating Doaramas from sites that already host gps track files.  We are starting to work towards supporting this functionality...
