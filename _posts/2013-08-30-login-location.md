Firstly, thanks to all the users who have been uploading, testing and sharing Doarama&trade; visualizations.  There has been a lot of helpful feedback, suggestions and bug reports.  This is valuable for us and helps us decide the future direction of the service so please don't hesitate to contact us.

Locations of activities are now recorded when you upload a file.

### API

We have had a number of requests for an API to allow creating Doarama&trade; visualizations from sites that already host gps track files.  We are starting to work towards supporting this functionality...
