There have been many requests for public viewing of Doaramas without logging in.  A very simple first pass of this is now online.

### New Doaramas

A new option on the authoring screen allows you to include the Doarama in the public feed or opt out.  If your Doarama is even _mildly_ awesome, please consider including it in the feed so others can see what you've been up to.

### Existing Doaramas

We've taken a conservative approach to the public feed so the Doaramas that you've already created won't show in the public feed unless you click the **Feed**  button to activate them in your activity list.  There has already been some amazing content posted so please consider going through your activity list to make interesting ones show in the public feed.
