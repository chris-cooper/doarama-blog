In case you missed it, we have reworked the Virtual Reality mode for Doarama&trade; to support the Oculus Rift DK2. We're now using WebVR, an emerging browser standard for interacting with Virtual Reality devices, currently in development by some guys at Mozilla and Google.

To use this _experimental_ feature you'll need to head over to [MozVR downloads page](http://mozvr.com/downloads/) and grab Firefox Nightly and the WebVR enabler. If you have any troubles, make sure you have configured your displays correctly according to the suggestions. Please be aware that WebVR is still in development and may not be an entirely smooth experience.
