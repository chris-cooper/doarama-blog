[![Elevation](/assets/2014-04-16-elevation.jpg)](http://www.doarama.com/view/2171)

Regular Doarama&trade; users may have noticed some subtle changes which we have just rolled out.

* An elevation profile is now displayed above the timeline to help give overall context.
* A mobile friendly rotary dial UI for focusing on a specific person has replaced the previous flat menu.  This UI component has been designed to be scalable to around 100 people.
* Elevation correction now corrects tracks which were previously floating a long way above ground.  Note that it still does not compensate for instrument drift during a flight.
* There was a regression bug in Firefox 28 that caused black rendering on some platforms.  This should be fixed in Firefox 29 and for now we have provided a workaround which disables themes in Firefox 28.
* Minor style changes across the site.
* The underlying code has been refactored to support live data feeds.

Quite a range of changes have been incorporated in this release so please don't hesitate to let us know if something is not working as expected. 

We are also pleased that more services are starting to incorporate Doarama&trade; visualizations via the [Doarama&trade; API](http://api.doarama.com/api/0.2/docs).
