[Tom Payne](https://github.com/twpayne) has just open sourced a [Go](https://golang.org/) client library for the Doarama&trade; API, which includes a command line client for creating Doarama&trade; activities and visualisations:

* [Go Client Library for Doarama&trade;](https://github.com/twpayne/go-doarama)
* [Doarama&trade; command line client](https://github.com/twpayne/go-doarama/tree/master/cmd/doarama)
* [Documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/twpayne/go-doarama)

They're MIT licensed.  Many thanks to Tom for this initiative!
