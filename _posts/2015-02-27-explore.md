In response to a number of requests we have received, we have just released an exciting change to the way you discover visualizations on Doarama&trade;. The old [Feed](http://doarama.com/explore) page has been retired and replaced by [Explore](http://doarama.com/explore), a Doarama&trade; visualization portal - allowing you to browse visualizations by location, activity type, time and more.

[Explore](http://doarama.com/explore) allows you to:

- Find visualizations by location using an interactive map.
- Filter visualizations based on activity type.
- Search for Doarama&trade; users and visualization participants.
- Sort visualizations by date created, date recorded or view count.
- Restrict visualizations to within specific dates.
- View only visualizations that contain synchronized video or images.

It is still an experimental feature so please [let us know](mailto:support@doarama.com) if you have any feedback or ideas on how to improve it.

Have fun exploring!
