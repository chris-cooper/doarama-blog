In case you missed it, we've rolled out some changes to the way we show stats in the viewer...

* The quantities displayed are now specific to the [activity type](/doarama/2015/04/24/activity-type.html).  E.g. paragliding activities will display different stats to running.
* You can now switch between metric and imperial units in the interface.
* Display GPX extensions including heart rate, cadence and temperature.
* Resize the panel, and select the main quantity displayed.
* Optionally view stats per activity (above the avatar icon).

Be sure to [let us know](mailto:support@doarama.com) if you can't find a stat that you're interested in!
