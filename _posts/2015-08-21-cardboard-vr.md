We've updated our support for Virtual Reality devices in Doarama&trade;. We've improved the Oculus Rift DK2 implementation and now support [Google Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) augmented mobile devices.

To get started using VR on a mobile device, ideally you'll need to grab yourself a Google Cardboard (or something similar). On your mobile, load up a Doarama&trade; visualization, hit the "VR Mode" button and then place your device in the Cardboard. To exit VR Mode, either hit the "back" button or hold a touch on the screen for 2 seconds.

Please be aware that this is all still a very _experimental_ and may not offer consistent results across different devices. [Let us know](mailto:support@doarama.com) if things aren't behaving themselves and we'll look into it.
