Thanks for showing interest in the Doarama project.  We have decided to release early as a public beta to gauge interest and to get valuable feedback which will help guide the future direction of the service.  We're hopeful that Doaramas will provide a unique and visually compelling way to tell the stories of your adventures and share them with friends.

We've had a number of requests to allow anonymous browsing of Doaramas.  Already there are lots of interesting adventures being posted, both aerial and ground based.  We're working toward enabling users to mark their Doaramas as public so they can show up in some sort of public feed.

Since this is a public beta, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have suggestions or frustrations.
