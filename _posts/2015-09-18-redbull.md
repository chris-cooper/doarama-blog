Thanks to a team-up with [Red Bull X-Alps](http://www.redbullxalps.com/), [Doarama&trade;](http://www.doarama.com) and [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/) you can now [relive highlights of the 2015 event in Doarama&trade;](http://www.redbullxalps.com/news/article/relive-the-day-10-battle.html)!

Behind the scenes the Doarama team worked hard to provide...

* A combined hike/fly activity type which automatically detects ground based sections of a GPS track so elevation corrections can be applied to improve the data captured by GPS tracking devices.
* Curtains shown below the trace line for an activity for aerial activities to help visualize altitude above terrain.
* Various performance improvements.

Be sure you check out the Red Bull X-Alps, and you can also take advantage of the new features and improvements in your own visualizations.

Thanks to the Red Bull X-Alps team including Tom Payne for making this happen, and to AGI who provided extra terrain serving capability through their [STK Terrain Server](http://www.agi.com/products/stk/terrain-server/).
