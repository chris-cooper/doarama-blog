We extend a warm welcome to users of Internet Explorer 11!  You can now upload and share visualisations of your outdoor activities on Doarama&trade;.
Since IE11 includes support for WebGL, the Cesium and Doarama&trade; development teams have been working hard to include support for this platform.
Point your shiny IE11 browsers to [an example paragliding visualisation](http://www.doarama.com/view/2171) to try it out now!

In other WebGL news, [WebGL support is on the horizon for both iOS and desktop Safari 8.0](http://caniuse.com/webgl).
It should only be a matter of time before Doarama&trade; is running on these platforms as well.
