[]()We were excited to find out that Doarama&trade; is proving useful for visualisation of bird flight.
[Prof. Dr. Ir. Willem Bouten and team](http://www.uva-bits.nl/contact/) in the
Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Amsterdam 
have been doing amazing work tracking bird movement and behaviour at multiple scales in space and time using their [UvA Bird Tracking System](http://www.uva-bits.nl/).
Click on the image above to see some of their work which was aired on Dutch television (Doarama&trade; visualisations start at around 2:20).
The team are interested in the bird's eye view that should be possible via the virtual reality headset support in Doarama&trade;.

For others interested in visualising tracked bird flight within Doarama&trade; we have added the activity type ***Fly - Bird / Aves***.

Here is an example visualisation of a tracked gull.
More info on this particular flight can be found [in this blog post](http://btoringing.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/guernsey-gull-off.html)
