If you want a bit more context for your Doarama&trade; visualization then try selecting the **bingLabels** map (under the gear menu).  As with other settings, the map you choose when creating a visualization will be saved, though anyone viewing it can also change it to their preference.  Make sure you explore the other viewing options in the menus too!
