We've just rolled out an extensive rework to the social aspects of Doarama&trade;.

* Follow your friends to have in-app and email notifications when they post new public visualisations.
* Filter [Explore](http://www.doarama.com/explore#?showFilter) results to only show users you are following.
* Hit the [shaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_sign) if you like someone's visualisation.
* Try out the new commenting system which uses your regular Doarama&trade; account rather than Disqus.
* Manage your email notification settings in [your user profile](http://www.doarama.com/profile).
