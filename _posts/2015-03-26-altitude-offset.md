Based on feedback from users there have been a few changes made to the way we handle aerial activities in Doarama&trade;.

* We have improved the speed and accuracy of the automatic altitude correction algorithm that is applied to flying activities.
* If for some reason the automatic altitude correction fails, you can now correct this yourself when authoring a visualization using the interface pictured.
These buttons vertically offset the whole GPS track for the currently selected activity.  You should see the results displayed immediately in the preview window.

We've also reworked the layout of the authoring interface.  As always, [let us know what you think](mailto:support@doarama.com).
