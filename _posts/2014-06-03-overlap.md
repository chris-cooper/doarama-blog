We've had a number of requests to allow greater control over which activities appear in a visualisation.
This is now possible through the revised UI shown above.
The list will also now be populated with up to 50 activities (previously 10) that were in the same area at the same time.
Once you have selected the activities you would like to see you can then proceed to create then save your visualisation.
