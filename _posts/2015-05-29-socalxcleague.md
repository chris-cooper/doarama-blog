[Southern California XC League](http://socalxcleague.com/) have just done some really nice work integrating Doarama&trade; into their website! As part of their service they are now providing Doarama&trade; visualizations of their paragliding competitions, complete with markers for the course and turnpoints.  These extra items are added using the DZML feature of the [Doarama&trade; API](http://www.doarama.com/api/0.2/docs).  To see some working examples head over to [the 2015 results page](http://www.socalxcleague.com/results/2015-results).
