The workflow for authoring, saving and sharing a Doarama has been tweaked since the old method was not intuitive.  The new workflow is as follows...

After you have uploaded a GPS track and set the meta data you should be presented with...

### The Authoring Screen

This is where you preview your Doarama, set appropriate playback speed, zoom level, themes, labels etc.  Once you're happy, use one of the options in the prominent <strong>Save / Share</strong> button to save the settings so they can be passed along to viewers of the Doarama.  A thumbnail image of your current 3D view will also be saved.

Doaramas can also be saved without sharing.  You can share them later directly from your activity list or using the viewing screen (see below).

### The Viewing Screen

The viewing screen currently fills the browser window (though this may change).  When you share a Doarama with your friends using the above mechanism your friends will by default have the settings/themes/labels etc you applied.  They can still change settings to suit their viewing preferences.  The share buttons in this view however acts to on-share the original Doarama you sent them, i.e. not their tweaks.

Please give this workflow a try and be sure to let us know if it's not working as expected!
