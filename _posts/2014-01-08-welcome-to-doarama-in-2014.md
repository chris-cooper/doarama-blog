#### Live tracking

[]()We are actively working on live tracking support for Doarama&trade;.  This functionality will provide a familiar Doarama&trade; user experience
for activities as they are happening rather than only uploading after the event.
This feature will be initially supported by a simple Android app.
The [Doarama&trade; API](http://www.doarama.com/api/0.2/docs) will also be extended to support live tracking to allow existing live tracking services to incorporate Doarama&trade; visualisations.

#### Doarama on the Web

[Sasha Serebrennikova](http://sashaz.com/about/) has created this beautiful video mixing Doarama&trade; visualisation with live footage in this flight from Ager to Sierra Ferrera ridge.  More info in the [blog post](http://sashaz.com/2013/12/13/sierra-ferrera-ridge-using-doarama-for-making-video/).
