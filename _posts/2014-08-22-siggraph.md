[]()Doarama&trade; was soft launched at SIGGRAPH in 2013 and we have not been idle in the year since!
The following video was presented this year at the SIGGRAPH 2014 Cesium users group.
It showcases some of the features that have been developed throughout the year such as multi-track support, public API, synchronized photo and video playback and virtual reality headset support.
The video also includes some amazing visualizations from Doarama users.  

Thanks to all users of the Doarama&trade; site and API!
Your feedback has been very valuable in helping us develop a better service.
