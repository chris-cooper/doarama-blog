[]()We have just rolled out [Oculus Rift Dev Kit 1](http://www.oculusvr.com) support for Doarama.
This allows you, the viewer, to experience real life GPS live or prerecorded activities as if you were flying alongside,
whether they be the bike ride you did on the weekend, or Tom Weissenberger's recent hang-gliding world record!

All you need to get started is an [Oculus Rift Dev Kit 1](http://www.oculusvr.com) and a WebGL capable browser with [vr.js](https://github.com/benvanik/vr.js/tree/master) installed.
Just click the new eye icon in the top right of the player to enter virtual reality headset mode.

Here are some [quotes from Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971) regarding their acquisition of OculusVR for $US2 Billion.

> "Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures."

> "One day, we believe this kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people."

> The goal is to "get this out at the most affordable price possible."

We also plan to support the low cost recently announced [Google Cardboard](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/)
which will enable a basic virtual reality viewing experience for those on a budget!
