### YALLDO Flying and the 40th Coupe Icare

All the best to those participating in the [40th Coupe Icare](http://www.coupe-icare.org/) festival of free flight!  We look forward to seeing some Doarama visualizations from St Hilaire du Touvet - Lumbin.

If you're visiting Coupe Icare make sure you drop by the [YALLDO Flying](http://www.yalldo.com/) booth to see a preview of Doarama visualizations integrated into the YALLDO Flying service.

YALLDO Flying is the first service to adopt Doarama's new web API.  Please don't hesitate to contact us if you are interested in finding out more about the Doarama API to include Doarama visualizations in your website.
