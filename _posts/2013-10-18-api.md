### REST API

We are pleased to announce our first release of the REST API for Doarama.
Head over to the [API docs](http://www.doarama.com/api/0.2/docs) for more information.
Thanks to [Yalldo Flying](http://www.yalldo.com) for adopting early and helping us to get this online. 

### Freeing the zoom

You are now free to zoom with your mouse (either wheel or right-drag) or pinch-zoom for touch devices.
This is a lot quicker and more intuitive to zoom out for a wider view for example.
Note that for zooming in very close you may still be better off using the old magnify controls (bottom right) due to the nature of the moving camera.

### Browsers and platforms

We've noticed on a lot of desktop and laptop machines that Google Chrome provides significantly better frame rates than Firefox so it's worth testing it if you have the option.
While it's still early days for WebGL support on Android we have had some success running Doarama on the Nexus 4 and 7.
If you have a recent high end Android phone or tablet then please give it a try and let us know how you go.  There's some additional info [here](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Mobile-Details).
Again, it's worth trying Chrome and Firefox on these platforms.
