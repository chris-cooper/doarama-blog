We've just rolled out support for embedding Doarama&trade; visualisations directly into blogs and websites.
Just access [the revised 'Embed' page](http://www.doarama.com/view/185564/embed) which is under the share menu of a visualisation (<i class="fa fa-share-square-o fa-lg"></i> in the top right of the viewer) and copy the HTML code to your clipboard.

Visualisations also now support [oEmbed discovery](http://oembed.com/).  To see an example of this in action, enter a visualisation URL (e.g. http://www.doarama.com/view/185564) into [an oEmbed Tester](http://oembed.frdnspnzr.de/).

As an example of embedding in action, here's a great visualisation created by Todd Smith of a hike in Palm Canyon embedded into this blog post...
