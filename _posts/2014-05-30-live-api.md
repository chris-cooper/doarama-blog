[![Live API]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-05-30-live-api.jpg)](http://www.doarama.com/api/0.2/docs)

The Doarama&trade; API has been extended to support live tracking.  This allows visualization of an event while it is being recorded.

The additions to the API are as follows.

* **Create an Activity** - You can now create an 'empty' activity without having to upload a file.
* **Post Location Samples** - You can now post location samples to an activity using a JSON schema similar to the HTML5 geolocation API.

A visualization created from these activities will then display the live data as it is posted to our server.
The image above from a test app shows 50 live streams in a Doarama&trade; visualization.

For further details head on over to the [API Docs](http://www.doarama.com/api/0.2/docs).
