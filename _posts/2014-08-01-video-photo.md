One of our most common support requests is to be able to add photos and video to the 3D map visualisation provided by Doarama&trade;.
We have just rolled out a range of changes to support this functionality via the YouTube and Instagram APIs.  Let's start with a couple of examples.

First up is Don Vella mountain biking on the new single track that has been added to the Oaks Fire Trail in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, Australia.

This is Simon Wilks with a Wing Wing Z-84 Autonomous Flight in the Swiss Alps.

Many thanks to Don, Simon and Chris for providing these examples which have been extremely helpful during development.
