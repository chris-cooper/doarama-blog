[]()One of our most common support requests is to be able to add photos and video to the 3D map visualisation provided by Doarama&trade;.
We have just rolled out a range of changes to support this functionality using the YouTube and Instagram APIs.  Let's start with a couple of examples.

First up is Don Vella mountain biking on the Oaks Fire Trail single track in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, Australia.

Next is Simon Wilks with a Wing Wing Z-84 Autonomous Flight in the Swiss Alps.  More detail on this flight [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK6j2pEe-xM)

Next is a bike ride by Chris Cooper with photos and annotations.

Many thanks to Don, Simon and Chris for providing these examples which have been extremely helpful during development.

Note that there are a number of features included in this rollout.

* New picture-in-picture control for displaying video and photos
* Revised text comment feature
* New edit UI (shown below)
* New time slider which shows when media is present and with improved usability on touch devices
* Updated 3D map display allowing you to jump in time e.g. to the start of a video by clicking on the dot or icon
* Using [STK World Terrain](http://cesiumjs.org/data-and-assets/terrain/stk-world-terrain.html) which has more detailed terrain data, particularly in Australia, Europe and USA.

There have also been some updates to the [Doarama Terms of Use](http://www.doarama.com/terms) to support the use of photos and videos.
