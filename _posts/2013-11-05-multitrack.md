We have had a lot of requests for visualizing multiple activities that occurred at the same time.
We are pleased to announce that this functionality is now online.  If you have previously clicked
on the Tom Payne paragliding demo on the Doarama&trade; front page, you may not have realized that Tom
was not alone on the flight.  You can now view the multitrack visualization of the flight by clicking on the above image.
Thanks to Tom Payne, Clement Latour, Ulrich Prinz, Sylvain Dhonneur and Damien De Baenst
for contributing their flight data to help in the development of this feature.

#### How to access multitrack

Now when you upload a track file there is an additional setting that allows you to indicate whether the 
activity shows up in searches.  Enabling this will allow others in the Doarama&trade; community to optionally include your track in their visualization.

If other users who you were participating with have already uploaded their track, you will then be presented with the following screen.  This currently
allows you the option of viewing all overlapping activities, or just viewing yourself (these options may become richer in the future).

If you select **View yours** you will be presented with the old singletrack functionality.  If you select **View all** you will be presented with the
new multitrack view shown below.

To select who the camera is following in the multitrack view, you have two options.  If you have jedi-like mouse handling skills you may click on the moving
avatar images to select who the camera focuses on.  If you find this a little difficult to do in practice (as I do), you can use the **Focus** menu top-right
to select the highlighted user.  Note that either of these approaches will change both who the camera is following, and also whose statistics are displayed.
