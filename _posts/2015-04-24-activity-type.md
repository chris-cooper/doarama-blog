**Selecting the correct activity type is important** when uploading GPS tracks. If you choose a ground-based activity type then the visualization will ensure the track is fixed to the terrain.  You can also change the activity type after a track is uploaded by selecting 'Edit Info' from the <i class="fa fa-gear fa-lg"></i> menu next to an activity in [your activity list](http://www.doarama.com/activities).
